# Lowes-Project

The Project is implemented using Node.js and Mongoose Db. 

Open the project in Visual Studio Code
Download the node_module folder from node_modules.zip file by unzipping it.(It is zipped because it has many folders,hence it could not be uploaded to github).

Postman API was used for testing.

Command to run the code - npm start(in terminal)

The urls are checked for the crud operations in Postman API
eg. http://localhost:3000/event - get request
